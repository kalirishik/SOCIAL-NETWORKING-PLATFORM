# Social-Networking-Platform
SocialDesk is a robust social networking platform designed to provide users with a safe and engaging online community experience. Leveraging the power of modern technologies and innovative features, SocialDesk ensures a seamless user interaction while prioritizing content moderation and user security.

## Features

- **Automated Content Moderation**: Leveraging NLP (Natural Language Processing) APIs, SocialDesk filters spam, profanity, toxicity, and harassment in user-generated content, maintaining community guidelines compliance.

- **Context-Based Authentication**: Enhancing user account security, SocialDesk considers user location, IP address, and device information for authentication, with immediate email notifications for suspicious login attempts.

- **User Roles**: Administrators manage the system, moderators handle community moderation, while general users enjoy typical social media functionalities like post creation, commenting, liking, and following/unfollowing users.

- **Admin and Moderator Dashboards**: Comprehensive dashboards empower admins and moderators with tools for system-wide management, user activity monitoring, and moderation tasks.

- **Email Notifications**: SocialDesk sends timely email notifications for authentication purposes and important system updates, ensuring effective communication with users.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js with Redux for state management, delivering a responsive and interactive user interface.

- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js power the backend, with MongoDB as the database for efficient data management.
