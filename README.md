# SOCIAL-NETWORKING-PLATFORM

SocialDesk is a comprehensive social networking platform built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It offers advanced features such as automated content moderation and context-based authentication, ensuring a safe and secure environment for users to connect and interact online.

## Features

- **Automated Content Moderation**: Leveraging NLP (Natural Language Processing) APIs, SocialEcho filters spam, profanity, toxicity, and harassment in user-generated content, maintaining community guidelines compliance.

- **Context-Based Authentication**: Enhancing user account security, SocialEcho considers user location, IP address, and device information for authentication, with immediate email notifications for suspicious login attempts.

- **User Roles**: Administrators manage the system, moderators handle community moderation, while general users enjoy typical social media functionalities like post creation, commenting, liking, and following/unfollowing users.

- **Admin and Moderator Dashboards**: Comprehensive dashboards empower admins and moderators with tools for system-wide management, user activity monitoring, and moderation tasks.

- **Email Notifications**: SocialEcho sends timely email notifications for authentication purposes and important system updates, ensuring effective communication with users.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React.js with Redux for state management, delivering a responsive and interactive user interface.

- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js power the backend, with MongoDB as the database for efficient data management.
